# React


Athens, May 2018, SHA class beta


Module : React


Student : Ioanna Talasli


Teachers : George Avgoustis and Stratoula Kalafateli


Task : Assignment provided by the teachers as preparation before beginning with react module in SHA


*Assignment before the React class*

Make a single page website that has a menu with 3 navigation items. The user needs to be able to click to each of these menu items and see each page.


*A) Posts*

A list of posts, only have a title and a body. Use dummy data you create, 3-4 items should be enough.

*B) Times*

This page will display three items named London, Paris , Athens and below each the time for each city is displayed in real time

*C) Profile*

A form with name,surname, email and password


Bonus points: if youâ€™ve done all of these use this API to populate the Home page with real data using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

Feel free to layout things however you want, again, css is secondary here, whats important is the functionality

By the way, by saying website we dont mean you have to set up node to serve it and so on. 
We only want what we described which can be accomplished with a single `index.html` and a single `main.js` file .
Avoid serving the website from a server and all that as its not related to react.
What you mainly need to re-remember is DOM manipulation with javascript which is what the assignment we came up with Stratoula is about.

Deadline : 30/05/2018 ---- Submission Date : 29/05/2018


---- homework week 1 ----

Render a basic static todo list with three items:

Todo List

* Get out of bed, Wed Sep 13 2017
* Brush teeth, Thu Sep 14 2017
* Eat breakfast, Fri Sep 15 2017


For each item render a description and a deadline date. Before you start draw a mockup and identify the components with colours. You have to use more than two components. Think which props the components should take.
